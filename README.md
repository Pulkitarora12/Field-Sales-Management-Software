# Field Sales Management Software (Field Sales Tracking & Reporting App)

A modern, robust web application built using **Java 21** and **Spring Boot** to enable field sales scouts, managers, and administrators to track client site visits, manage schedules, and analyze daily field sales performance.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Secure Authentication & RBAC**: Implementation of Spring Security with Role-Based Access Control (`ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `EMPLOYEE`). Offers custom local credentials login as well as **OAuth2 (Google login)** integration.
*   **Visit Records Tracker**: Field sales scouts can document detailed client visits, logging parameters such as:
    *   Company information & contact person details.
    *   Visit type (New vs. Revisit).
    *   Nature of business & current software systems in use (Tally, computer setup, serial numbers, etc.).
    *   Sales opportunities identified (New license, Upgrade, TSS, Service, Customization).
    *   Whether a demo was agreed upon, and scheduling revisit dates.
    *   Support for adding dynamic custom fields to visit records.
*   **Automated Revisit Reminders**: An active background scheduler (`ReminderScheduler`) runs a daily cron job to scan scheduled revisit dates and send automated email alerts to the designated scout prior to the revisit.
*   **Daily Analytics & Synchronization**: Automatic aggregation and synchronization of visit records to generate daily reports (`DailyRecord`) for each scout.
*   **Comprehensive Admin Panel**: Administrators have restricted access to:
    *   Monitor all registered employees.
    *   Modify roles or remove employees.
    *   Search and filter across all visit records and aggregated daily stats.
